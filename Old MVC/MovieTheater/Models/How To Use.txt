To be able to to see MySQL data sources, you need two components to be able to connect to MySQL db from VS 2015:

1) MySQL Connector/Net
2) MySQL for Visual Studio
 
You can get them both by installing MySQL installer that allow you to installer any MySQL components into your machine.

You cannot rely on DLL alone.
